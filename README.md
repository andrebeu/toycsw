# main
- splitting controlled by RNN
  - reasonable B>I without any optimizing
- next steps:
  - optimize learnrate and stsize for better initial learning 
  - gridsearch splitting params to eval robustness and best fit
  - change eval method to normalized 2afc

## delta+rnn branch
- splitting controled by delta learner, performance evaluated on rnn
  - good B>I without much optimizing
